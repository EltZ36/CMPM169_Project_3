There are some things money can't buy. For everything else, there's MasterCard.
Taste the Rainbow
Melts in your mouth, not in your hands
It's everywhere you want to be
The best a man can get
Have a break, have a Kit Kat

Think small
The snack that smiles back
The future of possible

We make money the old-fashioned way. We earn it.

Takes a licking and keeps on ticking
Betcha can't eat just one
Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is

Life's messy, clean it up
Where do you want to go today?
Melt in your mouth, not in your hands
Impossible is nothing
See what's possible
Get the sensation
When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight
Let your fingers do the walking
The toughest job you'll ever love
The happiest place on Earth
Because I'm worth it
A diamond is forever
When you care enough to send the very best
The best tires in the world have Goodyear written all over them
Think outside the bun
Obey your thirst
Finger-lickin' good
Stronger than dirt
A little dab'll do ya
The San Francisco treat
It's not just for breakfast anymore
I can't believe I ate the whole thing
You're in good hands with Allstate
The breakfast of champions
It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken
We try harder
Only you can prevent forest fires
You're not fully clean unless you're Zest-fully clean
The thrill of victory, and the agony of defeat
The taste you can see
Have a Coke and a smile
Always low prices. Always.
You've got questions, we've got answers
Stronger than dirt
The quicker picker-upper
It takes a licking and keeps on ticking
Reach out and touch someone
When you care enough to send the very best
The ultimate driving machine
Think small
We bring good things to life
Snap, Crackle, Pop!
Makes learning fun
Taste the Rainbow
Melts in your mouth, not in your hands
It's everywhere you want to be
The best a man can get
Have a break, have a Kit Kat
